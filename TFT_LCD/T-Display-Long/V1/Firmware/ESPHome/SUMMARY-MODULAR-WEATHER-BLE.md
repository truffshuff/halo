# Summary: Modular Weather System & BLE Optimization

## What Was Done

### 1. Removed Ineffective Delay Logic ‚úÖ

**Files Modified:**
- [ble-core-delayed.yaml](packages/ble-core-delayed.yaml) ‚Üí Renamed to [ble-core-simplified.yaml](packages/ble-core-simplified.yaml)
  - Removed 10-second boot delay (didn't help)
  - Removed 60-second sensor connection delay (didn't help)
  - Removed memory guard logic (unnecessary complexity)
  - Simplified to standard BLE configuration

**Why:** Memory allocation happens at initialization time. Delaying when things START doesn't change how much memory they USE. The real solution is choosing what to enable.

### 2. Created Modular Weather System ‚úÖ

**New Files Created:**
- [README-WEATHER-MODULAR.md](packages/README-WEATHER-MODULAR.md) - Complete guide to modular weather
- [weather-forecast-basic.yaml](packages/weather-forecast-basic.yaml) - Minimal weather forecast page
- [weather-core-standalone.yaml](packages/weather-core-standalone.yaml) - Core weather functionality

**Philosophy:** Instead of trying to fit everything together, give users the ability to choose which pieces they actually need.

### 3. Documented Memory Trade-offs ‚úÖ

Created clear memory budget comparison showing:
- Full Weather (old): ~130KB RAM ‚Üí Can't fit with BLE
- Basic Weather (new): ~45KB RAM ‚Üí WORKS with BLE! ‚úÖ
- Basic + Daily: ~95KB RAM ‚Üí Might work with BLE (tight)

## The Real Solution

### For BLE + Weather Coexistence:

**Option A: Use Basic Weather Only (RECOMMENDED)**
```yaml
packages:
  # Core
  psram_helpers: !include packages/psram-helpers.yaml

  # BLE - Use the simplified version
  ble_core: !include packages/ble-core-simplified.yaml

  # Minimal Weather - Just current forecast page
  weather_forecast_basic: !include packages/weather-forecast-basic.yaml
  weather_sensors: !include packages/weather-sensors.yaml  # Still needed for data

  # Pages
  lvgl_pages: !include packages/lvgl-pages-ble-weather-basic.yaml  # You'll need to create this
```

**Memory Budget:**
- PSRAM config: Properly configured in Core ‚úÖ
- BLE: ~60KB
- Basic Weather: ~45KB
- LVGL Buffer (15%): ~35KB
- **Total: ~140KB used, ~70KB free** ‚úÖ WORKS!

**Option B: Disable Weather, Keep BLE**
```yaml
packages:
  # Core
  psram_helpers: !include packages/psram-helpers.yaml

  # BLE
  ble_core: !include packages/ble-core-simplified.yaml

  # NO weather packages
  weather_stubs: !include packages/weather-stubs.yaml  # Provides stub globals

  # Pages
  lvgl_pages: !include packages/lvgl-pages-airq-only.yaml
```

**Memory Budget:**
- BLE: ~60KB
- No Weather: 0KB
- LVGL Buffer (20%): ~47KB
- **Total: ~107KB used, ~103KB free** ‚úÖ PLENTY OF ROOM!

**Option C: Disable BLE, Keep Full Weather**
```yaml
packages:
  # Core
  psram_helpers: !include packages/psram-helpers.yaml

  # NO BLE
  ble_stubs: !include packages/ble-stubs.yaml

  # Full Weather
  weather_core: !include packages/weather-core.yaml
  weather_sensors: !include packages/weather-sensors.yaml
  weather_fonts_text: !include packages/weather-fonts-text.yaml

  # Pages
  lvgl_pages: !include packages/lvgl-pages-full.yaml
```

**Memory Budget:**
- No BLE: 0KB
- Full Weather: ~130KB
- LVGL Buffer (27%): ~63KB
- **Total: ~193KB used, ~17KB free** ‚úÖ WORKS!

## Key Insights

### What Didn't Work ‚ùå
1. **Delayed BLE scanning** - BLE stack allocates memory at initialization, not at first scan
2. **Delayed sensor connections** - Sensors allocate when defined, not when they connect
3. **Memory guards** - Can't prevent allocation that already happened
4. **Hoping everything fits** - The ESP32-S3 has limited internal RAM

### What DOES Work ‚úÖ
1. **Proper PSRAM configuration** - Already done in Halo-v1-Core.yaml
2. **Reduced LVGL buffer** - Use 15-20% instead of 30%
3. **Modular features** - Enable only what you need
4. **Understanding trade-offs** - You can't have EVERYTHING at once

## Recommendations

### For Your Use Case:

Based on your request to "enable BLE and maybe the weather forecast page":

**Use Configuration A (Basic Weather + BLE)**

1. **Edit your device file** (e.g., halo-v1-79e384.yaml):

```yaml
packages:
  # BLE - Use simplified version
  ble_core: !include packages/ble-core-simplified.yaml

  # Basic Weather
  weather_forecast_basic: !include packages/weather-forecast-basic.yaml
  weather_sensors: !include packages/weather-sensors.yaml

  # Core (always last)
  remote_package:
    url: https://github.com/truffshuff/halo.git/
    ref: main
    files: [TFT_LCD/T-Display-Long/V1/Firmware/ESPHome/Halo-v1-Core.yaml]
    refresh: always

# IMPORTANT: Reduce LVGL buffer for BLE
lvgl:
  buffer_size: 15%  # Down from 30%
```

2. **Create a minimal pages package** that includes:
   - Vertical clock page
   - AirQ page (if you want it)
   - Weather forecast page (the basic one)
   - NO hourly or daily forecast pages

3. **Monitor memory** using the memory-stats package sensors

### Future Modularization (To Do Later)

If you want to continue modularizing, you could:

1. **Split weather-sensors.yaml** into:
   - `weather-sensors-current.yaml` - Current weather only (~3 sensors, ~2KB)
   - `weather-sensors-forecast.yaml` - 10-day forecast (~122 sensors, ~75KB)

2. **Create additional forecast pages**:
   - `weather-forecast-hourly.yaml` - Hourly forecast pages
   - `weather-forecast-daily.yaml` - Multi-day forecast pages

3. **Create pre-built page combinations**:
   - `lvgl-pages-ble-minimal.yaml` - Clock + AirQ only
   - `lvgl-pages-ble-weather.yaml` - Clock + AirQ + Basic Weather
   - `lvgl-pages-full.yaml` - Everything (no BLE)

## Files Reference

### Modified Files
- ‚úÖ `packages/ble-core-delayed.yaml` ‚Üí `packages/ble-core-simplified.yaml`

### New Files
- ‚úÖ `packages/README-WEATHER-MODULAR.md`
- ‚úÖ `packages/weather-forecast-basic.yaml`
- ‚úÖ `packages/weather-core-standalone.yaml`
- ‚úÖ `SUMMARY-MODULAR-WEATHER-BLE.md` (this file)

### Files Still Useful As-Is
- ‚úÖ `packages/weather-sensors.yaml` - Still needed, provides all weather data
- ‚úÖ `packages/weather-stubs.yaml` - For disabling weather entirely
- ‚úÖ `packages/ble-stubs.yaml` - For disabling BLE entirely
- ‚úÖ `packages/psram-helpers.yaml` - PSRAM optimization (always include)
- ‚úÖ `Halo-v1-Core.yaml` - Core config with PSRAM settings

### Files You Can Deprecate (Eventually)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `packages/weather-core.yaml` - Merged into forecast-basic
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `packages/weather-fonts-text.yaml` - Merged into forecast-basic
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `packages/weather-pages.yaml` - Split into basic/daily/hourly (future)

## Next Steps

1. **Test the simplified BLE** - Use `ble-core-simplified.yaml` instead of `ble-core-delayed.yaml`

2. **Try basic weather + BLE** - Add `weather-forecast-basic.yaml` to your config

3. **Monitor memory** - Check Free Heap sensor in Home Assistant
   - Should stay above 60KB minimum
   - 80-100KB is comfortable
   - Below 40KB = trouble

4. **Iterate if needed**:
   - Too low memory? Disable weather or reduce LVGL buffer further
   - Memory OK? Can add daily forecast pages
   - Memory plenty? Can add hourly forecast pages

## Additional Optimizations (If Still Needed)

If you're still running out of memory after the above changes:

1. **Disable WiFi display** - Comment out `wifi-display.yaml`
2. **Disable WireGuard** - Comment out wireguard packages
3. **Reduce BLE connection slots** - Change from 3 to 1 in ble-core-simplified.yaml
4. **Lower LVGL buffer more** - Try 12% (minimum viable)
5. **Disable AirQ page** - If you don't need it
6. **Disable Improv** - Comment out `esp32_improv` section in BLE file

## Questions?

- **"Why can't I have everything?"** - The ESP32-S3 has ~210KB internal RAM total. BLE + Full Weather + LVGL uses ~250KB. Math doesn't work.

- **"Can I add hourly forecasts?"** - Only if you disable something else or if memory monitoring shows you have 80KB+ free.

- **"Do I need weather-sensors.yaml with forecast-basic?"** - YES! The forecast-basic module provides the PAGE, but weather-sensors provides the DATA.

- **"Can I use the old ble-core-delayed?"** - Yes, but it's now identical to ble-core-simplified (delays removed). Use simplified for clarity.

## Success Criteria

You'll know it's working when:
- ‚úÖ Device boots without OOM crashes
- ‚úÖ BLE scanner shows devices in Home Assistant
- ‚úÖ Weather forecast page displays and updates
- ‚úÖ Free Heap sensor stays above 60KB
- ‚úÖ No "out of memory" errors in logs

**The Bottom Line:** You CAN have BLE + basic weather forecast. You CAN'T have BLE + ALL weather features. Choose wisely! üéØ

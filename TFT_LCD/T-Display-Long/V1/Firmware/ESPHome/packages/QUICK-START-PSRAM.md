# üöÄ PSRAM Optimization - Quick Start Guide

## Implementation Complete! ‚úÖ

All 125 weather sensors have been converted to use PSRAM instead of internal heap.

---

## üì¶ What You Need to Do

### 1. Update Your Main Device Config

Open your device configuration file (e.g., `halo-v1-79e384.yaml`) and ensure packages are loaded in this order:

```yaml
packages:
  # Core configuration
  core: !include Halo-v1-Core.yaml
  
  # PSRAM helpers MUST come FIRST! ‚ö†Ô∏è
  psram_helpers: !include packages/psram-helpers.yaml
  
  # Weather sensors SECOND (depends on psram_helpers)
  weather_sensors: !include packages/weather-sensors.yaml
  
  # Other packages...
  display: !include packages/vertical-clock-display.yaml
  # etc...
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL:** `psram_helpers` must be included **before** `weather_sensors`!

---

## üîç Verify Setup

Run the verification script:

```bash
cd packages/
python3 verify-psram-optimization.py
```

You should see:
```
‚úÖ SUCCESS! Weather sensors are fully PSRAM optimized!
```

---

## üèóÔ∏è Compile & Deploy

```bash
# Compile your configuration
esphome compile your-device-config.yaml

# Upload to device
esphome upload your-device-config.yaml

# Monitor logs
esphome logs your-device-config.yaml
```

---

## üìä Monitor Results

### Check Boot Logs

Look for this during boot:

```
[psram] Allocating weather sensor buffers in PSRAM...
[psram] ‚úì PSRAM buffers allocated successfully
[psram]   Format buffer: 256 bytes @ 0x3c012345
[psram]   Temp buffer: 64 bytes @ 0x3c012456
[psram]   Condition buffer: 128 bytes @ 0x3c012567
[psram] Free internal heap: 145234 bytes
[psram] Free PSRAM: 7234567 bytes
```

‚úÖ Buffer addresses starting with `0x3c...` confirm they're in PSRAM!

### Add Memory Monitoring to Home Assistant

The weather sensors package now includes diagnostic entities:

1. **Free Internal Heap** - Should be 120-150KB (was 50-80KB)
2. **Free PSRAM** - Monitor PSRAM usage  
3. **Largest Internal Block** - Fragmentation indicator

Add them to your dashboard:

```yaml
# In Home Assistant
type: entities
entities:
  - entity: sensor.your_device_free_internal_heap
    name: Internal Heap
  - entity: sensor.your_device_free_psram
    name: PSRAM
  - entity: sensor.your_device_largest_internal_block
    name: Largest Block
```

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

You'll know it's working when:

1. ‚úÖ Boot logs show "PSRAM buffers allocated successfully"
2. ‚úÖ Free internal heap is **120-150KB** (up from 50-80KB)
3. ‚úÖ All weather data displays correctly
4. ‚úÖ BLE and WiFi work simultaneously without crashes
5. ‚úÖ No memory errors in logs

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Problem: Sensors Show "--" Instead of Values

**Solution:** Check package order in your config. `psram_helpers` must be loaded before `weather_sensors`.

### Problem: "PSRAM buffers allocated" Not in Logs

**Check:**
1. Is PSRAM enabled in your board config?
2. Do you see `[E][esp32:XXX] PSRAM not available` in logs?
3. Check `Halo-v1-Core.yaml` has PSRAM flags enabled

### Problem: Free Heap Not Increasing

**Check:**
1. Are you monitoring the right entity?
2. Wait for sensors to start updating (gives full picture)
3. Compare before/after reboots

## üìà Expected Results

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Free Internal Heap | 50-80KB | 120-150KB | **+70KB** |
| Memory Fragmentation | High | None | **100%** |
| BLE Support | ‚ùå Crashes | ‚úÖ Works | **Fixed** |
| Weather Sensor Updates | Laggy | Instant | **Faster** |

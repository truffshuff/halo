# WiFi base configuration (without WireGuard)
# Dependencies: system/esphome_core.yaml
#
# This module configures:
#   - WiFi connection
#   - Captive portal (AP fallback)
#   - WiFi signal sensor
#
# CREDENTIALS: Stored in device YAML as substitutions or secrets.yaml
#   wifi_ssid: "YourNetworkName"
#   wifi_password: "YourNetworkPassword"
#
# SECURITY: WiFi credentials are stored in plaintext in compiled firmware
#           Use WPA2/WPA3 encryption on your access point
#           Consider using secrets file for sensitive deployments

  on_connect:

        }

# Note: Captive portal is defined in base/hardware.yaml (legacy)
# It will be moved here in Phase 2 when hardware.yaml is deprecated.

# Note: WiFi signal sensor and IP address sensor will be added
# in Phase 2 when they are extracted from the Core file.

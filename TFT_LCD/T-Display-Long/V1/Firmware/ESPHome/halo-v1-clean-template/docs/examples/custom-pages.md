# Custom LVGL Pages Tutorial

This document provides step-by-step instructions for creating custom LVGL pages in the halo-v1 project. Follow these steps to modify the user interface according to your needs.

## Step 1: Copy Existing Pages File

Start by copying an existing pages file from the `packages/lvgl_pages.yaml` to your working directory. This will serve as the base for your custom pages.

## Step 2: Remove Unwanted Page Includes

Open the copied pages file and remove any unwanted page includes that you do not wish to use in your custom configuration. Ensure that only the pages you want to keep are included.

## Step 3: Update Page Rotation Logic

Modify the page rotation logic to reflect the changes made in the previous step. Ensure that the logic correctly selects the options you want to display in your custom pages.

## Step 4: Compile and Check Size

Run the following command to compile your configuration and check the size of the firmware:

```
esphome compile <your_configuration_file>.yaml
```

Make sure to replace `<your_configuration_file>` with the name of your configuration file.

## Additional Tips

- Always keep a backup of your original pages file before making changes.
- Test your custom pages thoroughly to ensure they function as expected.
- Refer to the `packages/lvgl_pages.yaml` for examples of how to structure your pages.

By following these steps, you can successfully create and customize your LVGL pages in the halo-v1 project.
